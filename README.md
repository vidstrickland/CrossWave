# CrossWave
CrossWave: A Global Game Jam 2017 Project

# Instructions
Tap to fire a pulse and launch the puck, each pulse will deplete a portion of your pulse meter. If your pulse meter gets too low, then you'll have to wait for it to recharge in order to fire another pulse.

# A Message from the Developers
CrossWave was developed in forty-eight hours for the Global Game Jam 2017. The build of the game in this repository is the state of the game at the end of the event, and as such it is fully playable, but still has a few noteworthy bugs.

We are incredibly thankful to the Orlando game development community and DAVE School for providing us a positive environment to develop in for the weekend, as well as to all of the other teams for being inspirational in so many ways, as well as providing insight and support when times were tough.
